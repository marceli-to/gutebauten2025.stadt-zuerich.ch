# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a hybrid Laravel 11 + Vue.js application for building voting/rating in Zurich (gutebauten2025.stadt-zuerich.ch). The architecture combines traditional Blade templates for the public site with a Vue.js SPA for the admin dashboard.

## Essential Commands

### Development Setup
```bash
# Backend setup
composer install
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
php artisan serve

# Frontend setup  
npm install
npm run dev          # Vite development server
npm run build        # Production build
```

### Testing
```bash
php artisan test     # Run all tests
./vendor/bin/pest    # Alternative test runner
```

### Code Quality
```bash
./vendor/bin/pint    # Laravel Pint code formatting
```
